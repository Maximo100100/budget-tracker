## Description 

Budget tracker is a PWA that works with an unstable connection. The apllication lets you manage your balence but also stores user data in the browser so if the connection drops the application will hold onto your data and upload it when possible, this makes the apllication feel fast regardless of whether you have a fast internet speed or not.
